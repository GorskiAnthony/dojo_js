# Pixel Art

The purpose of this dojo is to create a canvas on which the user can express his talents as a pixel artist.
A __style.css__ file is available and contains all the classes necessary for the realization. It is only necessary to write __javascript__.

## Step 1
In the script.js file, write the script that will generate in the application (identified by the id `#app`), a colour palette from the `colors` array.

## Step 2
Write the script that will generate an html table underneath the previously generated colour palette and whose number of rows and columns will be determined by the `canvasSize` variable.

## Step 3
When the user selects a colour from the palette, they can draw pixel by pixel in the canvas.
